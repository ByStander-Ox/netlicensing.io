#### We updated our Terms of Service

As the NetLicensing community continues to grow, we are making some changes to provide the best possible experience for our users.
Therefore, we've updated our [Terms of Service](https://www.labs64.com/legal/terms-of-service/netlicensing/2-3/) policy that clearly outlines rights, responsibilities, our privacy policy and more details about our products and services.
The Terms of Service will be effective as of September 1, 2017.

If you have any questions, please contact us <a href='mailto:netlicensing@labs64.com'>here</a>.

Thank you for being a part of the NetLicensing community!
