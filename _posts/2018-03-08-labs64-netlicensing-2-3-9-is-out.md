Today we launched a whole new reason for software vendors to love NetLicensing: We are excited to announce the release of *NetLicensing 2.3.9*.
We have added a load of new features and improvements to help *ISV* to enable enterprise-grade license management.

Notable changes in this release:

## Offline licensing using NetLicensing Agent

[NetLicensing Agent](https://www.labs64.de/confluence/x/AwAKAQ) enables a secure, traceable, and flexible way of enabling offline licensing in the environments without access to the NetLicensing services.

## New Licensing Model "Quota"

This new [licensing model](https://www.labs64.de/confluence/x/5wAKAQ) defines the capacity limits (e.g. units, requests, volume, etc.) for a certain product feature.

## Enabled pre-accounting for the “Pay-per-Use” Licensing Model

Existing licensing model [“Pay-per-Use”](https://www.labs64.de/confluence/x/uQCo) was extended by pre-accounting capabilities and now allows reservation of the usage limits by customer.

## PayPal Recurring Payments

With the PayPal [“recurring payments”](https://www.labs64.de/confluence/x/vwCo) option, you can achieve seamless subscription management and license renewal.
