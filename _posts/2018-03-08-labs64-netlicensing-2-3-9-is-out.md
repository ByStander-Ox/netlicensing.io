Today we launched a whole new reason for software vendors to love NetLicensing: We are excited to announce the release of *NetLicensing 2.3.9*.
We have added a load of new features and improvements to help *ISV* to enable enterprise-grade license management.

Notable changes in this release:

### Offline licensing using NetLicensing Agent

NetLicensing Agent enables a secure, traceable, and flexible way of enabling offline licensing in the environments without access to the NetLicensing services.

### New Licensing Model "Quota"

This new licensing model defines the capacity limits (e.g. units, requests, volume, etc.) for a certain product feature.

### Enabled pre-accounting for the “Pay-per-Use” Licensing Model

Existing licensing model “Pay-per-Use” was extended by pre-accounting capabilities and now allows reservation of the usage limits by customer.

### PayPal recurring payments

With the PayPal recurring payments option, you can achieve seamless subscription management and license renewal.
