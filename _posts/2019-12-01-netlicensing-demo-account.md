* Ease the on-boarding process at the third-party projects utilizing NetLicensing license management services.


### Please note, some limitation apply while using demo account:

* "demo" is a shared account, so the data you are using will be accessible to everybody - beware of privacy.

* You might expect, that your "demo" account data and configuration will be reset at any time.

* Do not use "demo" account for your production license management.
