*"Licensing"* - a word that brings fear to the heart of Software Vendors.
Licensing management is complex, time-consuming; and confusing for everyone.
The seemingly endless difficulties - operating your own licensing service in 24/7, allocating maintenance resources, a lack of flexibility and the endless hours spent tracking licenses through e-commerce systems not designed for software licensing.

It can all end in disaster!

- What if there was **another way**?
- What if you could **manage** your **licenses** dynamically?
- Adapt to the needs of each individual customer and offer them a **tailored solution**?
- All whilst **reducing** development and administration **costs**?
- And **increasing** your customer base?

With Labs64 NetLicensing, you can do all of that and so much more.
NetLicensing is a *Licensing-as-a-Service (LaaS)* solution designed to manage all of your licensing. - Yes, ALL!
