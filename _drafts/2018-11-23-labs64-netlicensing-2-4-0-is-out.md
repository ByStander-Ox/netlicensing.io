Just in time for the NetLicensing Cyber Weeks, we are releasing the new version of *NetLicensing 2.4.0 - Cyber Edition* and we are bringing a bag full of goodies to help ISV enabling enterprise-grade license management.

Notable changes in this release:

## Support multiple API Keys with different roles

NetLicensing API keys have been reworked in order to allow vendors easy management of the multiple API keys as well as to associate key role, that grants access to a specific NetLicensing API subset.

## Hardware dongle protection for NetLicensing Agent

[NetLicensing Agent](https://www.labs64.de/confluence/x/8QAKAQ) enables a secure, traceable, and flexible way of enabling offline licensing in the environments without access to the NetLicensing services. Protection NetLicensing Agent instance by hardware dongle introduced an additional level of security and prevents cloning of the agent components in the virtual environments, as well as from attempts to revert the use counters/time accounting by restoring the environment from an older snapshot.

## Enable new licensing model "Pricing Table (beta)"

With the introducing of the new Licensing Model "Pricing Table (beta)" NetLicensing offers seamless management, integration and validation of the pricing plans for the vendors' products (from Desktop software to SaaS and IoT).

## NetLicensing Shop: Update Stripe integration API

Labs64 NetLicensing is an official Stripe Verified Partner and offers you a seamless integration of Stripe payments in the NetLicensing Shop.

## GDPR: Collect customer consent in NetLicensing Shop

In order to provide vendors with better support for GDPR regulations, customer consent can be collected in NetLicensing Shop and easily accessed by the Vendor (Controller) via NetLicensing Management Console.


As well as a set of useful improvements and defect fixes such as:
* NetLicensing Management Console: improved Dashboard performance
* Updated NetLicensing [client libraries](https://www.labs64.de/confluence/x/xgCo) to be compatible with the latest NetLicensing API
