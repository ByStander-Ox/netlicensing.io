Effective 1 January 2015 tax regulations are changed for the online sale of telecoms, broadcasting and digital content to private individuals who are resident in the European Union (EU).
Tax became payable in the country where the customer resides. Anyone selling digital goods such as newspapers, music, software, games or services (SaaS) within the European Union is affected.

This change clearly has wide-ranging implications for the tax requirements of affected companies. Those are the key areas where the businesses affected: taxation, pricing strategy, invoicing and third party integrations.
It is essential that you review your processes for compliance.

NetLicensing will make you ready for these regulations and establish your VAT configuration and purchasing process as simple as possible.

We put together a little flowchart, to facilitate our invoicing.
