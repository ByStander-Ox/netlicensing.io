The effective use of images and photography on your website and blog can have a massive impact upon the message which you convey to your customers. A phrase which is well known and perhaps now a little too often used – _a picture speaks a thousand words_ – is actually truer now than ever before. The advent of ever smaller technology and a greater degree of reading ‘on the go’ it has become absolutely paramount to make you website content as eye-catching as possible. If you have strong title and header image people are more likely to bookmark any blog posts of yours which they are linked to by friends and colleagues, than those which are pure text.

It is important then, to make sure that the company which you use to purchase your stock images will offer you a fair deal and won’t impose any unreasonable restrictions on your use of the images which you purchase. After all, it is all well and good having a great image but if it comes with a watermark that covers most of the picture then it is not going to be nearly as effective as you might have hoped in conveying your message – rather any one viewing the post at a glance may not even think that you have paid to use it. When this is far from true.

In this article we will look in brief at three of the largest Stock Image Companies and how they prefer you to credit them for use of their products.

**Getty Images**

Widely considered to be the leading supplier of Stock Images and Photography, the reputation of Getty Images is second to none. The prices which they offer may seem expensive at first, particularly if you look at their subscription service – 50 downloads per month for $399 USD. However, 60,000 of these images are royalty-free.

If you have seen any of Getty’s images in use before you will know that they all carry an individual watermark which identifies both the source website and the individual photographer: http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/Creative/Frontdoor/NewWatermark
