At NetLicensing, our promise to you is to make licensing management painless for software vendors. To that end, we are extremely happy to announce that *NetLicensing 2.3.7* is now Generally Available!

Notable changes in this release:

* Effective January 1, 2015, the new telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services [regulations](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/vat/telecommunications-broadcasting-electronic-services_en){:target="_blank"} are changed, and mandatory for all businesses which are providing digital goods and services to EU residents. In order to satisfy these rules and minimize implications on the vendor side, we’ve introduced **VAT/Tax ID Support** in NetLicensing Shop.
* **Transfer Licenses** between licensees allowing flexible assets reallocation and perfectly extending stateless integration of external e-Commerce systems via [NetLicensing Gateway](https://github.com/Labs64/NetLicensing-Gateway){:target="_blank"}.
* As usual, we've implemented many improvements and bug fixes across NetLicensing Modules: *NetLicensing Core*, *NetLicensing Management Console*, *NetLicensing Shop*, *NetLicensing Gateway*, *NetLicensing Client Libraries*, and *NetLicensing Documentation*.

For a detailed list of changes in this release, see [NetLicensing 2.3.7 Release Notes](https://www.labs64.de/confluence/x/jgHx).
