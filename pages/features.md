        <p>Labs64 NetLicensing is a first-class solution in the Licensing as a Service (LaaS) sector.

            Based on open standards, it provides a cost effective, integrated and scalable platform for software vendors
            and developers who want to concentrate on their productâ€™s core functionality instead of spending resources
            on developing an own license management software.</p>
